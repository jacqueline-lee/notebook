## Module 1 Overview
- Process notes should be instructions on how to replicate what I've done
- Active listening -> how it's marked  
-> everyone gets full marks
- Personalized email feedback this week
- Tie project to annotations, class discussions, and lecture
- Do better annotations  
-> you can link to individual annotations  
-> more than one annotation per article  
- Complete + truthful logging  
-> What software? what programs within software?
- Paradata doesn't have to be long but it has to be meaningful + thoughtful
- Doesn't grade on a curve

## Module 2
- Putting Roman Woman in a Well  
-> British Museum models  
-> different types of model  
-> used meshmixer -> try meshmixer before meshlab, meshlab has no undo function  
- 3D model sources  
-> Sketchfab  
  -> British Museum  
  -> Smithsonian  
    -> they have catalog numbers attached to find the artifacts online
- Simplify models  
-> "reduce triangles" or "decimate mesh"  
- Could also sonify
- Point is to transform the original model
- Twitterbots  

# Museums and Reproductions
j.mp/3812-feb12

### Plaster casts
- Museums from last week  
-> filled with replicants  
  -> common practice from early museums  
    -> plaster casts -> youtube video  
- Plaster casts of the frieze from the Parthenon
- Dying Gladiator/Gaul -> very common in Europe
- Art schools used plaster casts to teach what "good art" was  
-> pushes nationalism  
- British did a lot of this to tie themselves to Roman Imperial might
- House of British guy in London, museum, full of cases
- Casts are eventually not enough  
-> Napoleon starts taking the originals  
-> museums compete to grab beautiful art to fill their halls  
- Copies aren't enough because every can have them
- Great Exhibit of 1855 (pre-World Fair)  
-> Cast Courts  

### Industrialization
- Victoria + Albert Museum  
-> opens Cast courts in 1873 to educate the unwashed masses, educating, taste  

### Industrialization of Academia
- Cast important for the training of scholars because not everyone can travel to see originals
- Title -> formalization/standardization to formalize the fields
- Mueso della Civilta' Romana  
-> museums become embarrassed of casts  
-> partage -> splitting of the finds in a dig  
- Mussolini - Fascism  
-> World's Fair in 1942 - EUR - Epcot for fascism  
-> EUR is filled almost entirly with plaster casts of everything  
-> not about cultural taste, about political taste  
  -> glory of Rome, but also implies Rome was plundered by other and he'll restore it
-> uses massive maps to link to history almost 2000 years prior  

### Casts to Cast-offs
- 1870s to 1920s -> casts are out of fashion  
-> museums would actually toss casts  
- Redemption  
-> lots of ancient monuments are only preserve through casts  
- Peplos kore - 530 BC  
-> casts can be painted like the originals  

### Brings Us Back to Digital
- How have Museums Dealt With This?
- What we've created is infinitely better than what was possible 10 years ago
- Problems for museums
  - will they allow models/modelling?
  - will they allow data to be downloaded?
  - will they allow data to be remixed?
  - will they charge a fee?
- Knee jerk reaction is to say "no"
  - legal rights to copyright?
- Position of Canadian Museums?
  - History Museum not open
  - Science + Tech gives metatdata info
    - can digitally reunite dispersed collections

### Bigger Fear: Misuse
- Reputation (mis)management
  - plaster casts were easier -> tangible, harder to steal
- Sanitization/theft of cultures when placed inside museums
  - Module 2: when you choose to remix with other items: are you doing damage to original culture of object by remixing this way?
