### Agenda
- Volunteer notetaker
- Epoisen
- Data science vs Digital History -> more quantitative vs qualitative
- Hypothesis  

#### Scary Mary
-> remixes not only exposes ne perspective bu also reveals a truth about creator  

- remixing coin sound auction  
->more coinage in a spot means more complex music  

Brian Foo-> datadrivendj.com  
-> New York income inequality along the subway line  

Erich von Daniken  
-> aliens created all of civilization ~ woah ~ (racism!)  
--> not all remixes are good or valid  

Joann Hammond -> remixing racist, colonial "history" fact signs  

Paul Daniel O'Donnell  
-> is it compelling? effective?  
-> is it truthful? academically, factually biased?  

Remixed Moby Dick through generator  

Mark Sample  
-> problematic use of remix  
  -> remixing eventually resembles the original  
  -> plain ol' mixing creates something entirely different    
-> "A mix brings something enw into being, something new from the source materils that was always latent."  

(skip to slide 16)
## Deformance + Interpretation
- McGann and Samuels
- Poet (etymology: epoiesen) when poems are read  
  -> creates emphasis
- Reading poetry backwards to change meaning
- Sample says this will always cirlce back to original  
  -> examine the deformity instead of the perfomance
- Understanding something new from the deformed version
- "Deformed work is the end, not the means to the end"  
  ->gives us permission to break things  
  
#### Topic Model
- Distribution of words  
-> change of topic over time via language used in articles  
- Graphing visualizations standardizes the weirdness of the original deformation  

#### John Adams' Diary
- musicalizing ideas + concepts  
-> identifying ideas with instruments -> bass thump is going to dinner  

#### Ways to Mix History that Prof Graham digs
- Sonification  
-> tutorial to 3 ways of achieving that  

Remixing history as generating empathy that is lost when we get mired in the formal academia of it  

- Twitterbots!  
-> creating from a database  
- Generative Grammars
- Recurrent Neural Networks  
-> Feed it text and it'll creating writing like the original  
- Maps -> overlaying images over present day
- 3D Scene Mashups  
-> Erik Varvel -> putting Sketchfab models into a world  
- 3D File Mashups  
-> Pericles + labrador -> Labracles  
-> Akin to political cartooning  
-> use meshmixer or meshlab  

- Where is authority here?
- Where is aura?
- Who is the author?
