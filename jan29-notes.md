# Computational Creativity and the ontological meaning of your models  

j.mp/3812-01-29  

### Can computers be creative?
-> computer output that would be considered creative if done by people  
  -> but what is creative in humans?  
    
Neural networks are scary shit -> take celeb porn dude  
-> we're just training the computer for their eventual takeover of the world, nbd  

Spore - game

- "Is this good x" not the right questions
-> Better
  - What are these things?
  - Why are they the way they are?
  - How did they get this way?
  - What do they mean?
-> mapping the thing but also a relationship of things related to original thing
  -> ethical implications?  
  
Never a neutral way to use techonology, only a mindful way  

- Need ontological framework to work through implications  
  
- Questions re: political economy  
-> is it play (automata), work (automation), or labour (algorithm)  
  
- Programming as forgetting  
  
- Colour gradations in dirt indicating events
  - different visions create different histories, but archaeology can only be done once because it destroys what it finds         
                            
- Excavations can reveal absences, a lack of something

### Vesuvius, 79AD
- Pyroclastic flow preceded by thermal blast, creates body voids
- Pseudomorphs -> body casts
  - casts of casts -> effigies rather than pseudomorphs
- Body parts remain
- Skeuomorphs -> something expressed in the material of something else
- Resin used rather than plaster of Paris -> can CT scan resin
- Can create other things, what does that mean?  

Permeability vs persistence
Enchainment vs containment -> more confusing
  -> how things travel + how they're entangled with other things  
  
- Archaeological theory is about things we find the present to use to tell stories about the past  

- Make vs create?  

- Computer a prosthesis (?) for thought  

- Creating a void and also a thing
-> model encloses a void  

Think about how things are created
