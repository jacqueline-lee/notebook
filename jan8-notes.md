# HIST 3812: Digital History

- Scary Mary: Mary Poppins horror recut
  - Technically not wrong
  - Recut surfaces a different side of Mary Poppins

- Experiment in what we can do with history that surfaces different truths

- Shawn Graham

	- Background in Roman archaeology
	- Acknowledges privilege of being a white cis male on the internet
	- Office: Paterson 406

	- At Carleton for 7 years, creating digital humanities
	
## The Plan
- Key Questions
- Weekly Flow
- My Responsibilities + Flow

## What does history look like? What does digital history look like?
- Digital history used to look like digitizing records
- Materiality of digital history -> concept of remixing

## From Roman archaeology background
- You build things to understand things you find, and you make mistakes along the way
	- Roman bricks for example -> seeing humanality in recorded cost
- This is a class about making

## Your mistake was a vital connection
- Point of class is not to succeed but rather to fail gloriously
- Marked on documentation of process
- It's a Mark Sample quote
	- Brian Eno and David Bowie used oblique strategy cards, to look at things with a different perspective
	- Fed digital humanities essays into a Markov generator (like an autopredictive text generator), quote is the result
- Deformance -> portmanteau of deform and performance
- Oblique Strategies for Digital Humanities
- Mistakes are more informative than successes

Making vs hacking -> making is about taking control

Examples -> break expectations of history

Metadata -> info describing data  
Paradata -> describes creation of metadata and data  
	- "so what?"  
	- Prepares us for the inevitable death of our projects  
	
Mission: "write" history by making
	- translating something physical into the digital and back again

Plain text files are "future proof"

Image on class site: Jacquard loom -> analog precursor to digital files

Core Philosophical Perspectives summary
- Benjamin -> sneers at facsimilies as art
- Latour -> facsimilies are actually important
- Fogu -> what happens when you digitize/digitalize
- Nowviskie -> materials constrain the product
